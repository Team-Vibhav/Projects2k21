                    Deforestation is a significant threat worldwide. This project aims to tackle illegal deforestation by correlating sound from forests to an already cached dataset sound of logging machineries. Based on Digital Signal Processing, the foremost concept of
                    this project is to detect the frequency of chainsaw/equipment employed for cutting trees, used for illegal deforestation. In this project two audio signals are mathematically correlated. Correlation between signals gives a statistical
                    measure up to which a given signal resembles another signal. Signals are consistently compared in frequency domain. For this sake, a mathematical algorithm called Fast Fourier Transform is applied on these signals before correlation.
                    Here, an audio signal with three merged sound frequencies is contrasted to different audio signals impending from the forest. Mathematically, Correlation coefficient is calculated which is a numerical measure of Correlation. The value
                    of this coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. Closer is the value of Correlation Coefficient to 1, higher is the chainsaw component in the composite audio signal. Concerned authorities are immediately notified if the value of Correlation
                    Coefficient exceeds 0.80. Detailed reports incorporating graphs of time domain and frequency domain as evidence of logging are also consigned. Within this framework, we have sighted deforestation as the primary problem to be annihilated.
                    However, this project can also be employed to detect and terminate illegal poaching of animals by sensing gunshot sounds. Moreover, it can also be used in the military to detect the sound of a weapon deployed near to a station/post,
                    thus, notifying enemy presence nearby. In contrast to exorbitant satellite imagery, this project aims at providing an optimal and feasible surveillance strategy to cease illegal deforestation, hence, serving a great purpose in improving
                    the degrading ecosystem functionally.
