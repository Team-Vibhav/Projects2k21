          Virtual telepresence robot consists of a robot with ESP 32 camera module which is placed on a remote location
          to capture surroundings in visual form using Arduino Uno.
          The captured visuals are displayed on the user's virtual reality headset processed by Arduino Uno. The video
          stream is displayed on the screen of the smartphone to be shown in two different parts. This is done to get
          accurate visuals through the VR lens. There are two eyepieces in VR headset, hence dual-screen mode is used.
          VR headset utilized is Google cardboard which is widely available.
          Virtual telepresence robot utilizes 11.1V Li-polymer battery which gives enough power to make bot last for
          complete venture without any interruption.
          Transmission is done using NRF24L01 shield and HC05 bluetooth module which relay the movement instructions to
          2DC and 2 servo motors. Use of NRF24L01 greatly increases the range of robot from conventional 10 meters to
          100 meters. Also the latency of NRF24L01 is 130 µs, this gives user’s real-time control and experience.
          An added feature allows the user to move the robot in direction of the user's head movement using an MPU 6050
          sensor hooked with an arduino in the user's VR headset. MPU 6050 sensor allows tracking in 6 directions thus
          allowing flexible movement control.
          Virtual telepresence robot has vast amounts of untapped potential which can be used in various fields. VTR can
          be deployed as a sensitisation robot in medical accommodations. VTR can also act as a utility handler for
          bedridden patients. While in tourism VTR will be able to provide experience of exotic locations at the comfort
          of your home. During pandemic situation VTR doubles as an surveillance robot for the affected areas.
