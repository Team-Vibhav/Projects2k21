          The approach of the project is interactive, innovative and quintessentially holistic. With the objective to
          make learning interactive, the project deals with making students visualise concepts in 3D. Apart from science
          the expanse of education using AR will help students to absorb the concepts thoroughly. This way they will be
          able to learn in a fun and easy way. Out of many benefits some are included in this project. Easy to
          understand about circuits, components and basic science.The students will get a better understanding of
          mathematical curves and conics sections. It gives students the privilege to see, observe and feel at the same
          time while learning. It will help Students with poor financial backgrounds who cannot afford coaching. User
          interface of this application is simple. Users will easily understand the concept of maths and circuits by
          using this application. This application will only run on devices which have API level 24 or greater.
          Predominantly unity, blender, and AR core is used in this project. Technological aspects of project include
          making 3d components of circuits, 3d shapes for math curve using Blender. Scripting will be done using C#
          language. We will write different scripts for different operations. Using AR we add digital content to live
          camera feed making that digital content look as if it is part of the real world. Although it's benefits and
          application is not confined to this project, we have ensured to include the concepts that will help students
          for better understanding of concepts that will help them to grow in future.
