                    This project aims to create LTspice schematic from hand-drawn circuits for the students who donâ€™t know how to use simulators. In this project, we are using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to recognize a circuit drawn on paper and create its simulation
                    on LTspice. It will recognize each component of a circuit and create its corresponding schematic. We have used segmentation using an algorithm for identification of open line elements capacitor, battery, ground, resistor etc. Machine
                    Learning is being used for identification of resistors and other continuous elements and Deep Learning for the identification of the values associated with each component. The user has to scan the hand-drawn circuit image and then
                    with the help of our model, we recognize the different components present in the circuit and simulate the same with the help of LTSpice Python API to generate the output waveform/graph. Students can learn various techniques of circuit
                    solving as learning to work with simulation software is still an essential skill despite this system being available which does not require any prerequisite knowledge of such software.
